# Cozy Page Width
An easy button for making webpages more readable when the lines are too wide for comfort. With one click, it narrows the width of the page.


## Why?

It's easier to read when the text falls within a more narrow space, such as the columns of a typical book or newspaper. The mind follows the text and takes it in more quickly.

Many sites don't consider that a lot of reading is still done on non-mobile screens. This can be a frustrating user experience.


## How?

It simply adds 25% left and right margins to the webpage with one click.


## That's it?

I'd like to expand on this but it's usually good enough for around 90% of the sites out there.

This was originally part of a project I started for learning how to make Chrome extensions that I've pulled into its own extension.
